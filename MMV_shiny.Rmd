## Objective of the Shiny app 
<br>
<br>
The <span style="color:blue">**Consumer Price Index (CPI)**</span> dashboard aims to provide users a friendly graphic tool that can be used to compare the evolution of the prices of the 282 items of the basket of goods and services. 

## Objective of the Shiny app 

The shiny application enables users:

- to select and download CPI data from 3 different datasets. 

- to visualize a hover plot to compare the evolution of prices of the 282 items.

- to compare the percentage contribution of these items to the overall CPI. 

- to find the Canadian dollar value of a given year in terms of another year.


## Consumer Price Index


## Price weights

```

## Calculator 

```

## Treemap



## Moving forward 

-	Add a hover [price kaleidoscope](https://service.destatis.de/Voronoi/PriceKaleidoscope.svg) that visualizes the price weights.

- Add a button to load the most updated data from the Statistics Canada website.

-	Add a calculator based on monthly user expenses that calculates a *personal CPI* which can be compared in a plot with the real CPI. 

- Add [animated plots](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen) where users can analyze CPI data against other economic variables (GDP, income, population growth).


## Moving forward

## Sharing and hosting 


The latest code of this app is hosted in [github](https://github.com/manolo20/cpi_dashboard_StatCan/)


```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE} 

shiny::runGithub('manolo20/cpi_dashboard_Statcan')

```

The dependencies used were: shiny, shinydashboard, DT, dplyr, ggplot2, plotly, treemap, CANSIM2R, openxlsx. The app is currently hosted at [shinyapps.io](https://kunov.shinyapps.io/consumer_price_index/) and at [AWS](http://18.222.224.189:3838/cpi_dashboard_StatCan/) . 

Developers of the application:
