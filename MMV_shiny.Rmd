## What is shiny?



The <img src="images/shiny-hex.png" height="50px" width="50px" /> library is a RStudio library that helps to create interactive web applications without the necessity to know any HTML, CSS or JavaScript.

It was developed by Joe Cheng from RStudio.

The main benefits of using shiny over other tools are:

1. Interactivity.
2. Easy to share.
3. Relatively easy to develop (compared to other programing languages). 
4. Open source library. (RStudio, stackoverflow, GitHub)

## Installing shiny

To install shiny we run:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages("shiny")
```

and then to load the library we just call:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library("shiny")
```

## Structure

A folder contating a basic shiny application is structured in two different ways:

1. A folder that contains a file named myapp.R which includes the ui and server functions:

```
myapp
│   app.R
└───data
│   └───data.csv
└───images
    └───image.jpg
```

## Structure

2. A folder that includes a ui.R and a server.R files:

```
myapp
│   ui.R
│   server.R  
└───data
│   └───data.csv
└───images
    └───image.jpg
```

## What is a ui?

The ui stands for **user interface** and it is the skeleton or layout of an application, for example, where a dropdown menu should be located, or which options a radio button menu should have, or the range of a slidebar. 

The ui is written using shiny functions and its output is raw HTML code.

The main three functions which define the various regions of the ui are:
- headerPanel, 
- sidebarPanel, and 
- mainPanel 

## What is a server?

Now let’s define a skeletal server implementation. To do this we define a server function that accepts two parameters: input and output.

The server function allows users to interact with the application by selecting specific inputs in the ui in order to obtain different results which can be in the form of plots, datasets, mathematical calculations, words, images. 

The UI is responsible for creating specific controls that a user can iteract with, while the server is translating the specific options selected in the ui into an actual plot or data.

## Examples
![](images/basic-widgets.png)
Now let's explore some of the examples that one can create using shiny:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
runExample("01_hello")
runExample("03_reactivity")
runExample("05_sliders")
runExample("09_upload")
```


## Creating a shiny application

Steps:

1. Have an idea on which data we want to use and how we want to present it.
2. Get the data (webscraping, accesing a database).
3. Clean the data.
4. Create a shiny application.
5. Share the application.
6. Listen to suggestions from users.
7. Improve the application.

## 1) Idea:

We will create a dashboard that visualizes GDP figures at the national level for all published NAICS (North American Industry Classification) industries.

## 2) Getting the data:

```{r, eval=FALSE}

library(CANSIM2R)

# We will get Table 36-10-0434-03: 
# Gross domestic product (GDP) at basic prices, by industry, annual average (x 1,000,000)
# From Statistics Canada

gdp_raw <- getCANSIM(36100434, raw=TRUE)

```
## 3) Cleaning the data:
```{r, eval=FALSE}

library(dplyr)

# Print the first rows of the dataset
head(gdp_raw)

table04 = gdp_raw

# Verify how many unique variables exist in a given colum name 
unique(table04$Seasonal.adjustment)

unique(table04$Prices)

unique(table04$GEO)



# Cleaning the data:
gdp <- gdp_raw %>% 
  filter(Seasonal.adjustment %in% "Seasonally adjusted at annual rates")%>%
  select("time"="X.U.FEFF.REF_DATE",
         "naics"="North.American.Industry.Classification.System..NAICS.",
         "value"="VALUE", 
         "prices"="Prices") 

# Creating a new column time1 which will be a "date" object.
gdp$time1<-as.Date(paste((gdp$time), "-01", sep=""))

gdp$time1<-as.Date(gdp$time1)


typeof(gdp$value)

```


```{r, eval=TRUE}
# Define UI for app that analyzes the GDP at the national level for all NAICS industries ----

ui <- fluidPage(
  
  # App title ----
  titlePanel("GDP Analysis"),
  
  # Sidebar layout with input and output definitions ----
  sidebarLayout(
    
    # Sidebar panel for inputs ----
    sidebarPanel(  
      
      # Input: selectInput allows users to choose a given industry ----
      selectInput(inputId = "industry",
                  label = "Select an industry:",
                  choices = unique(gdp$naics)), 
      
      # Input: radioButtons allows users to choose a price measure ----
      radioButtons(inputId = "prices",
                   label = "Select price measure:",
                   choices = unique(gdp$prices))
      
    ),
    
    # Main panel for displaying outputs ----
    mainPanel(
      
    )
  )
)

# Define server logic required to draw a histogram ----
server <- function(input, output) ({
  
  })
  


# To run the app:

shinyApp(ui=ui, server=server)
```

## 4) Creating the shiny application:


```{r, eval=TRUE}
# Define UI for app that analyzes the GDP at the national level for all NAICS industries ----

ui <- fluidPage(
  
  # App title ----
  titlePanel("GDP Analysis"),
  
  # Sidebar layout with input and output definitions ----
  sidebarLayout(
    
    # Sidebar panel for inputs ----
    sidebarPanel(
      
      # Input: selectInput allows users to choose a given industry ----
      selectInput(inputId = "industry",
                  label = "Select an industry:",
                  choices = unique(gdp$naics)), 
      
      # Input: radioButtons allows users to choose a price measure ----
      radioButtons(inputId = "prices",
                   label = "Select price measure:",
                   choices = unique(gdp$prices))
      
    ),
    
    # Main panel for displaying outputs ----
    mainPanel(
      
      # Output: Plot ----
      plotOutput(outputId = "plot2", height = "800px", width = "700px")
      
      
    )
  )
)

# Define server logic required to draw a histogram ----
server <- function(input, output) {
  

  # This expression will generate a plot that is wrapped in a call
  # to renderPlot to indicate that:
  #
  # 1. It is "reactive" and therefore should be automatically
  #    re-executed when inputs from the ui change
  #
  # 2. Its output type is a plot
  
  
  output$plot2 <- renderPlot({
    
    dat <- gdp %>%
      filter(naics %in% input$industry ) %>%
      filter(prices %in% input$prices)
    
    ggplot(dat, aes(x= time1 , y= value, group=1))+
      geom_line()+
      theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size=11, angle=90))+
      scale_x_date(date_labels = "%b %y", date_breaks = "1 year")

  })
  
}

# To run the app:

# shinyApp(ui=ui, server=server)
```

## 5) Sharing the application:

- shinyapps.io
- Ocean Digital
- Amazon Web Services
- Microsoft Azure




## Objective of the Shiny app 
<br>
<br>
The <span style="color:blue">**Consumer Price Index (CPI)**</span> dashboard aims to provide users a friendly graphic tool that can be used to compare the evolution of the prices of the 282 items of the basket of goods and services. 

## Objective of the Shiny app 

The shiny application enables users:

- to select and download CPI data from 3 different datasets. 

- to visualize a hover plot to compare the evolution of prices of the 282 items.

- to compare the percentage contribution of these items to the overall CPI. 

- to find the Canadian dollar value of a given year in terms of another year.


## Consumer Price Index


## Price weights

```

## Calculator 

```

## Treemap



## Moving forward 

-	Add a hover [price kaleidoscope](https://service.destatis.de/Voronoi/PriceKaleidoscope.svg) that visualizes the price weights.

- Add a button to load the most updated data from the Statistics Canada website.

-	Add a calculator based on monthly user expenses that calculates a *personal CPI* which can be compared in a plot with the real CPI. 

- Add [animated plots](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen) where users can analyze CPI data against other economic variables (GDP, income, population growth).
